## Project Euler -- The Scala version ![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/fedcuit/projecteuler.svg?branch=master)

You may need to set `JAVA_OPT` to `-Xmx2g` to make sure there is enough heap size to run the application.

I start this project to learn `Scala`, especially practice collection operation in `Scala`, so some of the implementation could be not concise enough, some of them even have performance issue, so any pull request is welcomed. ^_^
